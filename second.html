        College students may feel that they do not have the time to partake in service learning.
        However, it can help students manage their time better. As said above, students develop their interpersonal skills when taking service learning courses.
        Time management is one of these skills that are developed during the course.

    <div class="counterarg2">
        Students may still feel the benefits are not worthwhile. Service learning provides key aspects that cannot be fully replicated in only the classroom.
        College students going out into the world and putting their knowledge and skills to the test is irreplaceable.

        Service learning was something I did not think was going to impact me much. It taught me how to communicate with others better, become a better listener, and how to work with others.
